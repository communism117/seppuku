A DoS script for browsers.

I hope your XSS is in order...

It is the user's responsibility to use this script wisely;
 The author takes ZERO responsibility for a user's use of
 this code for malicioius or unlawful purposes. This is
 just a proof of concept.
Don't break any laws; test only on yourself and/or
 consenting party(s) only.
 
If you really want to get arrested use this yourself
 on your home computer/server on an unconsenting 
 party; there is no proxy or Tor support, the DoS
 attack is in the clear.
 
A smart person would stick this script on as many
 websites as possible (XSS), and anyone going to those
 sites will become an unwitting participant in a DDoS
 attack. 
 This is good because the unwitting participants can't
  be arrested for something they had no idea they were
  part of.
